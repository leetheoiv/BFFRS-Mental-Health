# BFFRS Mental Health Dashboard

## Project Desription
- In this project, I used the [The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system) survey dataset on Kaggle to answer three questions and create a dashboard based around mental health the survey accounts for a wide range of indicators but I only wanted to look at mental health indicators:
  
  Q1: Is there an association between being queer identifying individuals and being diagnosed with depression or anxiety by a provider?

  Q2: Do Bisexual indivdiuals have poorer mental health compared to their gay counterparts?

  Q3: Is there an association between being non-cis, the state, and being diagnosed with depression or anxiety by a provider?
  
## Tools
- I used Python to clean the data and conduct exploratory analysis. Then I used the cleaned data in Excel to build the interactive dashboard.
  
## Overall Findings:
1. Bisexual People, bisexual women,specifically report a higher rate of days their mental health isn't good compared to gay people.
2. People that that reported their sexuality to be other have a higher rate of depressive/anxious symptoms compared to other groups
3. Non-binary people are more likely to experience more depressive/anxious symptoms compared to other gender minorities. Especially, in states like Georiga, North Dakota, and West Virgina
